			<h1>CPJava: Basics</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Welcome to the Bush School Computer Programming in Java class. You might jave written programs 
            before in some language like JavaScript or Python. 
            In many ways Java programming is similar, but you will notice immediately 
            that the basic Java "Hello, World!" program looks pretty confusing and complicated. 
            Here's a Java program that prints "Hello, World!". 
            Press the <em>Run</em> button and the program output should appear to the right of the code in what is called
			the <em>console</em>.

        <p>
            <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/java/691b755fde" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>
        Luckily though, one line of code in this program is much more important and interesting than all the rest.
		For now we are just interested in 
		<h2><code>System.out.println("Hello, World!");</code></h2>
		We will ignore everything else. This line of code an example of a Java <em>statement</em>. If we think of Java as a language like
			English, a <em>statement</em> is like a sentence. The same way a period ends an English sentence, a semi-colon marks the end of
        		of a Java statement.
		<p><code>"Hello World!"</code> is an example of a Java <code>String</code>. A <code>String</code> is a collection of letters, digits,
			punctuation and/or spaces. The beginning and end of the String are marked with <em>double quotes</em> (<code>"</code>).
	
		<h2><code>print()</code> vs <code>println()</code></h2>
		<p><code>System.out.println()</code> prints first and then inserts a <em>newline</em> character so that <em>whatever is printed next
			is printed on the next line</em>. (Pressing the `enter` key on the keyboard creates a new line character) Run the following code and you'll notice top and bottom are printed on separate lines.
		<p><iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/java/d1020fa31a" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>Java has another printing function. <code>System.out.print()</code> which does NOT insert a newline.
			Change the first statement to <code>System.out.print("Top");</code> Then run the program to
			make sure that "Bottom" is printed on the same line as "Top".
		<p>Now change the second statement to <code>System.out.print("Bottom");</code> and notice that the output doesn’t change
			since nothing is printed after "Bottom".
		
		
		<h2>Escape Characters</h2>
		
		<p>Escape characters are special symbols in Java that begin with a backslash <code>\</code>
			A good way to remember the difference between a backslash and a forward slash is that a backslash leans backwards ( \ ),
			while a forward slash leans forward ( / ). The Java escape charater for newline is <code>\n</code>. 
			<code>System.out.print("Top\n");</code> would have the same effect as <code>System.out.println("Top");</code>.
			Using the escape character for newline allows you to insert a line break anywhere inside some text. 
			Run the following
			code and you'll see "Top" and "Bottom" on separate lines.

		<p>Other escape charaters are:
		<ul><li><code>\t</code> Insert a tab in the text at this point
		<li><code>\'</code> Insert a single quote in the text at this point
		<li><code>\"</code> Insert a double quote in the text at this point
		<li><code>\\</code> Insert a backslash in the text at this point
		</ul>
		<p>Try changing the newline in the program to one of the other escape charaters then run the program and see what
	  	is printed.	
		<h2>Comments</h2>
		
		<p>Lines that begin with two slashes <code>//</code> are ignored by Java. Multiple lines are ignored
		if they are between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>. Comments have no effect on the execution
		of the program. They are used to create notes to yourself or other programmers. They make it easier for other programmers (and your future self) to understand what you meant to
		do. As your teacher, I'll sometimes give you some unfinished code with the instructions for completing it in comments.

		<h2>Arithmetic operators</h2>
		<p><code>+ - * /</code> are called <em>arithmetic operators</em> and are used for addition, subtraction, multiplication
		and division.
		
		<h2>Literals vs Expressions</h2>
		<p>Double quotes around text tells Java it is an <em>literal</em>. Java will print a literal exactly as written. Here’s
		an literal <code>"4/4"</code>. If I write the same thing without double quotes it's called a <em>expression</em>. Java
		evaluates expressions to find a result. Run the following program and you will see that Java prints the literals
		exactly as they are written (including spaces!), and evaluates the expression first and then prints the result.

		<h2>Debugging Error Messages</h2>
		
		<p>Errors in programs are called “bugs.” The process of fixing program errors is called “debugging.” When you try to
		run a Java program with a bug you will often get an error message. When you are learning a new programming language,
		you will make many errors. Errors are ok, just fix them and move on. For example, I wanted the following program
		to display my first name "Art."
			
		<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/java/a8d2bf7fc5" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>Instead of printing my name, the program shows an error message when it runs. In this case I made a <em>syntax error</em>.
		Syntax is the grammar and spelling of a computer language. In this example I forgot the double quotes around my name.
			
		<p>Another type of error is a <em>logic error</em>. This time I misspelled my name. The computer doesn’t know my name,
		so the program runs incorrectly without an error message.
			
		<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/java/2e9bf5c9b5" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>Sometimes a logic error "crashes" the computer and stops the running program. Logic errors that crash the computer are
		called <em>Exceptions</em> and produce an error message. Here I made the logic error of dividing by zero.

		<h2>Formatting Java Code with Spaces</h2>
		
		<p>In Java programs, some spaces are required. For example, you need at least one space between <em>keywords</em> like
		<code>public</code>, <code>class</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>void</code>
		The program below is not legal. Run it and you will get an error message that says so.
			
	        <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/java/a6db0d4f07" width="100%" height="200" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			
		<p>Other spaces are optional. Here is another version of the program. It runs, but it is difficult to read the code because it 
		is written on one line with no indentation. We use 
		spaces like indentation to make programs easier to read and debug.

		<h2>Assignment: Four 4s challenge</h2>
		<p>Use exactly four 4's to write an expression that evaluates to every integer from 1 to 10, using only the
		four arithmetic operators + - * / and ().
		No decimals, factorials, square roots, exponents, or other symbols are allowed. The first one has already been done 
		for you. Submit the link to your finished program by choosing <em>Share | Link</em>. Go to Google Classroom and
		and then choose	<em>Add Link</em> to submit the assignment. Don't forget to click the <em>Turn In</em> button. If you have extra time, see if you can get the numbers after 10; 11, 12, 13 and so on.
