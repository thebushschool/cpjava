## Project: Pins and Threads

1. Create a 2D array of 50 pins (pins[]) to store 2 elements - random x and y coordinates to fit within the canvas. To create pins look up createVector() function call from [P5JS Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/). Then use it in a custom function that creates pins and assigns them to each element of the pins array.
1. Create a 1D array of 50 colors (colors[]) to store 4 elements - 3 primary colors and one transparency(alpha). To create colors look up color() function call from [P5JS Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/). Then use it in a custom function that creates colors and assigns them to each element of the color array.  
1. Draw small circles at each pin at the x,y coordinate from the pin array and with color from the color array. 
1. Draw a line from the each of the pins in the array to the current mouseX and mouseY positions when mouse is pressed. 
1. Write a custom function that will save what is shown on canvas at that moment as a png file when _typing_ (not "pressing") 's' or 'S' key. Lookup 'saveCanvas' function in [P5JS Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) and use it in the custom function that you write. 

* STD Team Look in [Slack #stdteamch for code extract and hit for saving canvas]().]
* ADV Team Complete the exercise in class and then proceed to working Robot Project
