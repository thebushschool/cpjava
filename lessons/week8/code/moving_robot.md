## Project: Moving Robot Project in 3 Parts

1. Modularize your Robot Project code using a drawRobot() user defined function refer to Chapter 9 “Robot 7 Functions” section in online textbook
1. Animate your Robot using techniques from Chapters 6 and 8. Submit to Github as Part 1.
1. Create an Array of Robot Objects refer to Chapter 10 and Chapter 11 "Robot 9 Arrays" section in online textbook. Submit to Github as Part 2.
1. Move the Robot Array Objects individually - Tween (Chapter 8-6), Shaking (Chapter 8-8), Random (Chapter 8-9), Circular Sin Wave (Chapter 8-12), Spiral (Chapter 8-15). Submit to Github as Part 3.

For Parts 2 & 3 we will enhance our code to a Javascript "Object" based implementation. There is a well-illustrated and comprehensive example of a “Mover" Object in the second online book we have recommended for  this class - [Nature of Code](). It starts in Section 1.7.  This book has some really nice examples that you will enjoy experimenting with!  

I expect that your implementation for Robot project Parts 2 & 3 to be much simpler than the full Mover object in the book.

I have purchased 10 copies of the [online versions of these 2 books]() for sole use of our class students - all of you.  You are free to use them for this class and other classes.
