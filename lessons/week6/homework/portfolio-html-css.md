# Week 6 Homework

## Portfolio HTML/CSS
_This assignment is Due Monday, 03/16 before class_

## Tasks (For Advanced Pathway students only)
1. Watch the [HTML/CSS video](https://youtu.be/ANqqQgAb4w0) (Just watch 12 minutes of the video. To upload to Github we are simply using Drag & Drop folder into Github directly in order to keep Git tasks simple)
1. Add titles and descriptions for each project, on that project's index.html page. There is no need to do this for your Exercises, just Projects. 
1. Create an external styles.css file and add your custom css
1. Link that external css file in the main index.html and on all of the project pages
1. Link your font in your main index.html page as well as all your project pages
1. If you get stuck or need help please post in html-css channel on Slack.

## Submission (For ALL students)


You should submit a link to your main student portfolio, to let me know when you are ready for your Projects and Exercises to be graded. 

All _Exercises and Projects will be due by Monday March 16th_ at the latest.  I will assign grades at that time ahead of Parent Teacher conferences.
