## Mini Lesson - First Steps in Learning how to Code! (15 minutes)

1. Walkthrough one example for the whole class
1. Open a NEW tab on your browser by accessing File-> New Tab 
1. Start a P5JS [Javascript web editor in the new tab created by clicking here](https://editor.p5js.org). Please be patient, it might take a few seconds to open.
1. Breakout into multiple rooms for doing a coding exercise!
   * Odd numbered teams Replace all code inside editor using [code for "Dynamic sticks" linked here](code1.md)

   * Even numbered teams Replace all code inside editor using [code for "Dynamic rectangles" linked here](code2.md)

1. Breakout to work on code for 10 minutes
1. When time is up select one teammember to display results to the class!
1. One [solution to each example can be found here](codesolutions.md). Only look here after you have attempted it within your team! 

## Telescope & Astronomy Cascade Preview (15 minutes)

1. Bush Cascades is a 3-week experiential and immersion program on a interdisciplinary course of study. 
1. They are held 2 times a year at the end of Fall and Spring semesters in January and May. They are open to all Upper School students execluding Seniors who will be doing their final projects instead.
