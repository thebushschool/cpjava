## Remote Classroom Tools

In our IDMD classroom we are already using tools and techniques that are naturally adapted to a remote learning format. We will continue using our already established tools and techniques for learning IDMD.  We will add to that, a video conferencing solution  to complete our toolset needed for remote learning! All applications (except email) are to be run using your Chrome Browser on your laptop. 

1. [ZOOM for IDMD](https://zoom.us/j/5176316708) - video conferencing application - join here each day and time IDMD classes are held
2. [IDMD WEBSITE](https://chandrunarayan.github.io/idmd/) - lessons, exercises, projects, student-portfolios, references
3. [SLACK Instant Messaging](https://app.slack.com/client/TTS9Y46VC) - differentiated classroom, code extract, bug fixes, instant help, quick challenges
4. [GITHUB repository](https://github.com/) - code submissions for exercises and projects, published student portfilios
5. [P5JS Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org) - web code editor for p5js
6. [Student Portfolios](student-work.md) - Links to Student Porfolios
7. [Online textbook](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/15GK0VESxqTvYGst9EtvILshb0MGlO4c5) - Getting Started with P5JS 
8. [Bush PORTAL](https://bush.myschoolapp.com/app/faculty#academicclass/109608285/0/bulletinboard) - links for all tools, official assignments, schedules, syllabus, grade rubric, conference appointments

#### A Reminder
We are all going through some extraordinary times due to the coronavirus.  I would like to ask you to think about those among us who are suffering due to this affliction. Let us take time to be vigilant about washing hands frequently, not touching our face and avoiding being in large groups. Most of all, be calm about things beyond our control.

## Course Description

Software influences all aspects of contemporary visual culture. Students will explore the essentials of Computer Programming including: cconditional control structures, iteration, data structures, functions, classes, objects, and event-driven design. We will create projects based on student interest including, but not limited to video games, installation art, and simulations of biological and social phenomena. We will learn and create using the programming language Javascript and the library p5.js, a full featured library that allows one to create interactive digital art for the web. To see examples of the interactive digital media you can create with code, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE) by the creators of p5.js.
