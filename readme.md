This course will be all about developing skills to simulate nature on your computer in a fun, engaging manner and learn Java on the side!</a>

# CPJava - Computer Programming in Java Course

This course is designed to introduce computer programming in the Java language. Learning to use a computer language is a necessary skill for all students regardless of discipline. In this course we will teach the fundamentals of computer programming from the stand point of simulation, automation, and problem solving of real-world systems and natural processes. At the same time, the design and implementation of computer programs is taught from the context of fundamental aspects of computer science, including the development and analysis of algorithms, the development and use of fundamental data structures, the study of standard
algorithms and typical applications, and the use of logic and formal methods. 

In addition, the year-long course will cover many of the topics necessary for preparation to the AP Computer Science A (APCSA) examination in May of next year 2024. You will need to register for this by October 2023. 

This is an introductory course in computer programming using Java. As such, no specific programming prerequisites are needed to take this course. However, additional preparation may be needed to fully prepare a student for the APCSA exam with no prior knowledge of computer programming.

### [Downloadable CPJava Course Schedule 2023-2024](src/schedule.png) 

Schedule updated 9/5/23

![alt text][schedule]

## Learning Modes
### Learning by Doing First - Student-Based Asynchronous Workflow
In this mode of learning we will simultaneously start a consolidated student-paced sessions spanning multiple Java Units, and by working on programming projects within [Paired Programming teams](#paired-programming-teams).  We will mostly be using this workflow model, switching to Synchronous teacher-led sessions in small bursts as needed.
### Doing by Learning First - Teacher-Led Synchronous Workflow
We will use this method at the start of each Unit, or for unfamiliar and difficult topics that might require a lecture-based instructional unit.  The [lesson plans are published](#student-paced-sessions-for-java-units) and always available as a reference while we live in the world of Asynchronous "Learning by Doing First" model above.

## Typical Workflow
1. Student attends CPJava classes in-person at Bush Campus

2. There are 11 Units in this course

3. Each Unit will have student-paced asynchronous and lecture-based  sessions that will guide the coverage of the content in each Unit

4. Each Unit will also have Exercises and Projects toon online sources.  These are assigned via the [Google classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/NjE4MjA5Nzk3NzM4)

5. Exercises are short code extracts, videos to watch etc. Projects aresolutions (programs) that you will write to meet a given specification.

6.these and submit them to Github these as directed.  Projects will always have a code submission that is due. In some cases exercises may not have a code submission, but you will still practice them online.

7. Once youthe exercises and projects, mark them asin the [Google classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/NjE4MjA5Nzk3NzM4). If you actually submitted code to Github, paste a link in the Google classroom assignment before marking it as complete.

### Expectations for School Work
![alt text][schoolwork]

## Paired Programming Teams
In the world of programming - [collaboration with others is everything](https://youtu.be/q7d_JtyCq1A)!.  We will model that in our learning process in the classroom. We will learn by doing and by pairing with others. Each person in a paired team will have the opportunity to teach and to learn from each other. We will be using the Paired Programming teams for team for learning Java and projects. ** Please provide me the Github Account usernames that you created **.  The Paired Programming projects will be published at this location.  I have updated paired programming teams for the 2nd-term also keeping in mind the students remote/on-campus students and those taking the APCSA exam.

## Course Credit

This course draws from the book Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp and materials used in the the CSAwesome curriculum. Credit for significant collaboration with CS programs taught at the Lowell High School by Art Simon in San Francisco and at the Boston Latin School by Long Nguyen is duly noted with thanks. Credit is also due to the many member founders of the Processing Foundation, especially Dan Shiffman whose tireless efforts have advanced the cause for open, accessible, and free CS education across the world.
